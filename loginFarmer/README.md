# loginFarmer
this is one of the services which is required in my KKD project.
this is basically as the name denotes the service which has functionality to login a farmer(user).
it post the data from user and get the data from database, then compare both the data and will verify whether the user is already registered or not and also tells whether all the credentials are matched or not
